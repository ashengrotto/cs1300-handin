        <div id="body">
        <p class="part-one-text">For this project, I had the goal of developing an interactive interface using components and an internal data state, all using React.
          In particular, I set out to build a site that displays a list of items and allows the user to filter and sort them, then add specific items to a favorites list aggregator.

        </p>
          <h2 class="part-title">Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p class="part-one-text">Before developing my own website with a favorites list feature, I began by analyzing how three existing companies implement this feature 
            (either on their mobile apps or web pages). In particular, I chose three brands I frequently shop at, <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a>, <a href="https://www.ulta.com/">Ulta</a>, and <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a>, as I am already somewhat familiar with their favoriting features.</p>

          <div id="og-imgs">
            <img id="original" src="./assets/ccc.png" alt="The Competitive Comparison Chart for three brands with a favoriting feature: Sephora, Ulta, and Starbucks"/> 
          </div>
            <p class="part-one-text">I built my competitive analysis off the framework that building a favorites list 
              allows users to keep track of products they either already love or want to try, which should thus enable them 
              to quickly order and view products placed on this list. Thinking in these terms, the ability 
              to see if an item is out of stock from within the list itself seems rather important, which is why I was somewhat 
              surprised when I realized Ulta did not implement this feature. Also, I found Sephora's implementation of 
              a sorting feature within the favorites list to be particularly effective, especially if the list contains many items: 
              through sorting by price or recency, the customer can quickly find specific items in a way they cannot with 
              either Ulta or Starbucks (this aligns with the "Effiency" design principle we discussed in that experienced users can 
              utilize these sorting features to quickly locate desired items, and "Learnability" in that it's clear placement at the top of 
              the page provides an obvious way for new users to sort through their lists).
            </p>

            <p class="part-one-text">Based on my competitive analysis and personal experience using these applications, I identified a few features I would like to attempt to implement on my own site:
              <ul>
                <li>Sort items using various parameters (such as recency or price)</li>
                <li>Access favorites list from the homepage of site</li>
                <li>Make filter/sort visible and easy for new users to grasp their functionality</li>
                <li>Display total number of items added to the favorites list</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          <h3 class="part-title">Parts 2: Set Up & 3: Functionality</h3>
          <p class="part-one-text">One of my biggest interests is in collecting fragrances and trying perfumes from different houses. As I am a student, I am tight on money, so it's important for me to budget 
            and plan my purchases accordingly, which includes keeping track of my existing collection and avoiding re-buys. As such, I had the idea of creating a simple website that could help people filter different fragrances by type (main scent families), and sort them by price, as well as allow users 
            to add them to a collection (an aggregator). I think this idea, if expanded upon, could be a really cool way to keep track of my growing collection of perfume bottles.
          </p>
