          <h2 class="part-title">Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p class="part-one-text">Before developing my own website with a favorites list feature, I began by analyzing how three existing companies implement this feature (either on their mobile apps or web pages). In particular, I chose three brands I frequently shop at, <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a>, <a href="https://www.ulta.com/">Ulta</a>, and <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a>, as I am already somewhat familiar with their favoriting features.</p>

          <div id="og-imgs">
            <img id="original" src="./assets/ccc.png" alt="The Competitive Comparison Chart for three brands with a favoriting feature: Sephora, Ulta, and Starbucks"/> 
          </div>
            <p class="part-one-text">I built my competitive analysis off the framework that building a favorites list 
              allows users to keep track of products they either already love or want to try, which should thus enable them 
              to quickly order and view products placed on this list. Thinking in these terms, the ability 
              to see if an item is out of stock from within the list itself seems rather important, which is why I was somewhat 
              surprised when I realized Ulta did not implement this feature. Also, I found Sephora's implementation of 
              a sorting feature within the favorites list to be particularly effective, especially if the list contains many items: 
              through sorting by price or recency, the customer can quickly find specific items in a way they cannot with 
              either Ulta or Starbucks. Though convenient, I don't think the ability to access one's favorite list from the 
              homepage (as Sephora and Ulta both include) is strictly necessary, as even though you can only access the list 
              through pressing the "Order" button within the Starbucks app the user will have to go through this menu anyway 
              to place a mobile order -- but it is nice to have. I also did not think that Ulta's implementation of a total item 
              counter was particularly useful, as unlike a cart I don't feel like the user needs to know how many items they've
              favorited -- it's more of  a place to keep all your staple or desired products together.
