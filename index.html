          <p class="part-one-text">I chose the homepage for a private cat breeding business called <a href="http://www.provenancecats.com/welcome-to-provenance-cats.html">Provenance Cats</a>, because I have an interest in cats and felt the website left a lot to be desired, including the color palette I found hard on the eyes. </p>
          <p class="part-one-text">Usability concerns</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The website homepage doesn’t utilize space in the most efficient way, with a wide gap between the top of the page and the navigation bar itself. This is wasteful of the entire screen’s space and looks somewhat disorganized.</li>
            <li>The color scheme of the website is difficult to read: the saturated dark teal background makes the black text blend in.</li>
            <li>Another</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="part-one-text">Accessibility</p>
          <p class="part-one-text">WebAIM WAVE identified numerous accessibility issues with the website, including  missing alternative text for images, contrast errors for text, and a lack of HTML structures including headers. I agree with WAVE’s findings BJKFDKFK</p>
