            <p class="part-one-text">For this project, I set the goal of re-designing an existing website to be more streamlined, accessible, and responsive to different screen sizes. 
                I chose the homepage for a private cat breeding business called <a href="http://www.provenancecats.com/welcome-to-provenance-cats.html">Provenance Cats</a>, because I have an interest in cats and felt the website left a lot to be desired, including the color palette I found hard on the eyes. </p>
          <p class="mini-header">Usability concerns</p>
          <p class="part-one-text">Before I actually began to plan my redesign, I identified a few usability concerns that I wanted to address. In particular:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The website's desktop homepage doesn’t utilize space in the most efficient way, with a wide gap between the top of the page and the navigation bar itself. This is wasteful of the entire screen’s space and looks somewhat disorganized.</li>
            <li>The desktop site also has an automatic music player, which feels very outdated and has the potential to startle anyone who views the website.</li>
            <li>The mobile homepage is strangely designed, with vastly different information from the desktop's homepage. On the mobile website, a large majority of the page is filled with various quotes about cats, while the desktop page lists more information about the business itself.</li>
            <li>On both pages (especially the mobile version, where it can be even more difficult to be precise), the social media logo icons are very small and difficult to click.</li> 
            <li>The color scheme of the website is difficult to read in both formats: specifically, the saturated dark teal background makes the black text blend in.</li>
        </ul>
          <p class="mini-header">Accessibility</p>
          <p class="part-one-text">WebAIM WAVE identified numerous accessibility issues with the website, including missing alternative text for images, contrast errors for text, and a lack of HTML structures including headers. I agree with WAVE’s findings in that I can imagine it would be very difficult for someone using a web reader to navigate this page. I also believe there are numerous other issues with the page that WAIVE wasn't able to identify: specifically, the contrast issue I previously identified of gray text against the teal backdrop.</p>

            <p class="part-one-text">I began with 9 speed sketches, each taking around a minute. I tried to incorporate different elements into each sketch and figure out which aspects I wanted to incorporate into my final design.</p>
