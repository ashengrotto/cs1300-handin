        <div id="body">
        <p class="part-one-text">In UX research, A/B testing is used to determine whether a variant of a page performs better than the original through statistical analysis.
          This project in particular involves conducting a simple A/B test on two different UI designs and analyzing the results; the overarching goal is to get familiar with the methodology of A/B testing 
          and learning how to prove, through statistics, whether a change to a web page results in a better user experience. Though not a perfect measure by any meanas, A/B testing can produce statistical data
          by focusing on specific metrics for the purpose of measuring improvements in user experience -- namely, how efficiently and quickly a user can successfully complete a certain task.

            <li>The "View Appointment" button was removed from the site.</li>
            <li>The list of available appointments was reorganized so they were listed by date (specifically, the April 26th appointment was moved to the end of the list from the middle.)</li>
            <li>The text of the "Schedule Appointment" button was changed from white to black.</li>
            <li>The location text for each appointment was underlined.</li>
